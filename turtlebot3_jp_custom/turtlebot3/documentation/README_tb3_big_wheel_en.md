## Setup Manual（Quick Start Guide）
### 1. Environment Setup
Some modifications from the original TurtleBot3 are required in order to use and test the new Big Wheel model from the TurtleBot3 Friends family. To do so, please follow the official TurtleBot3 e-Manual 「[Quick Start Guide](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/)」. Please, take note of the following changes that are pointed out.

- About [1.1. PC Setup](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/#pc-setup)
Big Wheel model uses whether Raspberry Pi 4B or NUC11 as SBC. Right now, ROS Humble
is also in process of development. Please, select the 「Foxy」 branch from the 「[Quick Start Guide](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/)」, the Humble version is not yet supported officially.


- Changes in [1.1.2. Install ROS 2 on Remote PC](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/#install-ros-2-on-remote-pc)

Prepare your environment installing ROS Humble/

```code
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROBOTIS-JAPAN-GIT/robotis_tools_jp/master/install_ros2_humble.sh
$ sudo chmod 755 ./install_ros2_humble.sh
$ bash ./install_ros2_humble.sh
```

- Changes in [1.1.3. Install Dependent ROS Packages](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/#install-dependent-ros-2-packages)

Now install some required packages.

```code
$ sudo apt-get install ros-humble-gazebo-*

$ sudo apt install ros-humble-cartographer
$ sudo apt install ros-humble-cartographer-ros

$ sudo apt install ros-humble-navigation2
$ sudo apt install ros-humble-nav2-bringup
```

- Changes in [1.1.4. Install TurtleBot3 Packages](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/#install-turtlebot3-packages)

Once ROS Humble is already installed, we will install some required ROS packages from the ROBOTIS Japan official GitHub site for TurtleBot3. Please, introduce the following commands in your terminal.

```code
$ sudo apt remove ros-humble-dynamixel-sdk
$ sudo apt remove ros-humble-turtlebot3-msgs
$ sudo apt remove ros-humble-turtlebot3
# If a warning message appears saying that there is no such packages, you can ignore it

$ mkdir -p ~/turtlebot3_ws/src
$ cd ~/turtlebot3_ws/src/
$ git clone -b humble-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK.git
$ git clone -b humble-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git
$ git clone -b humble-jp-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-JAPAN-GIT/turtlebot3_jp_custom
$ cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
$ colcon build --symlink-install
$ echo 'source ~/turtlebot3_ws/install/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

- Changes in [1.1.5. Environment Configuration](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/#environment-configuration)

Let's setup the ROS environemnt.
```code
$ echo 'export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30 #TURTLEBOT3' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

- About [3.2. SBC Setup](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/sbc_setup/#sbc-setup)

In the new Big Wheel model, NUC11 is used as main processing computer, instead the Raspbery Pi 4B that has being used in `Buger` or `Waffle Pi` models. We will omit the usual SBC setup setup. Please follow the next steps in your NUC.

> **Warning**
> We did not conduct yet any experiments to confirm the correct movement in the actual robot. Please, follow the next instructions in your own responsability. Thank you!

> **Note**
> In the case you want to still use Raspberry Pi 4B, please follow those steps from the TurtleBot3 e-Manual.

1. Install Ubuntu 20.04.

2. Install ROS Humble.

3. Install TurtleBot3 required packages as it follows

```code
$ sudo apt remove ros-humble-dynamixel-sdk
$ sudo apt remove ros-humble-turtlebot3-msgs
$ sudo apt remove ros-humble-turtlebot3
# If a warning message appears saying that there is no such packages, you can ignore it

$ mkdir -p ~/turtlebot3_ws/src
$ cd ~/turtlebot3_ws/src/
$ git clone -b humble-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK.git
$ git clone -b humble-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git
$ git clone -b humble-jp-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-JAPAN-GIT/turtlebot3_jp_custom
$ cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
$ colcon build --symlink-install
$ echo 'source ~/turtlebot3_ws/install/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

- Changes in [3.3. OpenCR Setup](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/opencr_setup)

The setup of the OpenCR is done through the NUC.

1. Connect the [OpenCR](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/) to te NUC through a micro USB cable.

2. Skip the installation of arm Debian packages (in NUC are not required).

3. Select ```big_wheel_noetic``` as the `OPENCR_MODEL`.
```code
$ export OPENCR_PORT=/dev/ttyACM0
$ export OPENCR_MODEL=big_wheel_humble
$ rm -rf ./opencr_update.tar.bz2
```

4. Download the firmware and uncompress it. (ToDo)
```code
$ wget https://github.com/ROBOTIS-JAPAN-GIT/OpenCR_jp_custom/releases/download/v1.0.0/opencr_update_jp_custom.tar.bz2
$ tar -xvf opencr_update_jp_custom.tar.bz2 
```

5. Burn the firmware into the OpenCR.
```code
$ cd ./opencr_update
$ ./update.sh $OPENCR_PORT $OPENCR_MODEL.opencr
```

6. If the firmware for the TurtleBot3 Big Wheel has been successfully burnt into the OpenCR, the following message will appear. (This is just an image)
![TB3 Big Wheel OpenCR Success Output](/turtlebot3/documentation/tb3_big_wheel_opencr.png)

### 4. Additional packages setup
In the new TurtleBot3 Big Wheel model, 「Realsense D435」 is used as defaut camera and 「LDS-series」 as default LiDAR sensor. Here, we will explain about its setup.

> **Warning**
> The following steps are conducted in the `remote PC`.

1. **Camera setup**

First of all, please install the requiered packages.
- ROS Wrapper for Intel® RealSense™ Devices (Based on official website)

```code
$ sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-realsense2-camera
$ cd ~/turtlebot3_ws/src
$ git clone -b humble-jp-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-JAPAN-GIT/realsense-ros_jp_custom
$ cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
$ colcon build --symlink-install
```

> **Note**
> If you want to know more in detail about the [realsense-ros](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros), please refer to the official GitHub repository.


1. **LiDAR setup**

In the case of TurtleBot3 Big Wheel as default, we use the same sensor provided in the original TurtleBot3. You can decide t use whether the LDS-01 or the LDS-02. In that case, please refere to the TurtleBot3 e-Manual to complete the setup
[3.2.8. NEW LDS-02 Configuration](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/sbc_setup/)
